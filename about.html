    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>BreadCorp Insurance was founded by Breadnz, a Minecraft player who knows the pain of losing valuable gear all too well. After too many deaths from mobs, falls, and creeper explosions, Breadnz had an idea: Why not create a company that helps Minecraft players recover from the inevitable? Thus, BreadCorp Insurance was born, specializing in DYDBs (Did You Die Boxes) to keep your valuable items safe and sound.</p>
    
    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
    <p>At BreadCorp, we believe that losing your loot shouldn’t ruin your day. Our mission is simple: Provide Minecraft players with the tools and peace of mind to keep adventuring without fear of losing their progress. No more walking around in bare feet after a horrible death—BreadCorp is here to make sure you’re always prepared!</p>

    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>From humble beginnings with just a single DYDB, BreadCorp has grown into the leading provider of item recovery services. We’ve helped countless players bounce back after tragic deaths. And we’re not stopping there. BreadCorp is expanding to offer more plans and options so that every player can find the right protection for their needs.</p>

    <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
    <p>Did you know that BreadCorp’s first insurance claim involved a player who lost not one, but TWO enchanted diamond pickaxes to a group of angry Endermen? Now THAT’s dedication to the cause. Thankfully, BreadCorp was there to save the day with a brand-new pickaxe.</p>
