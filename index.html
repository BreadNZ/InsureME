            <p><strong>CreeperChaser2000:</strong> "I thought I was safe from the exploding creepers in my underground base… but one snuck up on me! I died and thought I’d lost everything. Thankfully, I had a BreadCorp insurance plan. My DYDB saved me from total ruin. If you’re not insured, are you even really playing Minecraft?"</p>
